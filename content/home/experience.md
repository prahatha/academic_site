    description: |2-        
        * Developed and executed a new research direction for the lab and set up an in vitro cell-based model to study traumatic brain injury using hiPSCs
        * Applied new ideas based on strong scientific evidence to establish a strategy and analyze mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium dynamics in this system
        * Initiated and managed external collaborations with mechanical engineers, scientists and clinicians to develop a novel device that delivers compressive forces

 - title: Graduate Student, Faculty for the Future Fellow

    description: |2-        
        * Established rods are functional in zebrafish larval visual behavior and defined scotopic parameters to drive only rod responses. Utilized this assay to manage, optimize and conduct high-throughput drug screening workflows in a pipeline project for retinal degeneration
        * Developed a new standard operating procedure for a visual behavior utilizing different zebrafish wildtype strains by applying statistical tools and effective collaboration with statisticians
        * Adapted a zebrafish cone mutant model of achromatopsia to investigate non-autonomous apoptosis in the retina. Developed and optimized testing protocols to probe the pharmacological effects of a naturally derived compound, on cell death in this model and performed mechanism of action research
        * Collaborated with research scientists to show pharmacological blockage (using Celastrol) of NADPH oxidases affects neurite outgrowth in bag cell neuronal cultures of Aplysia
        * Assisted in CRISPR design, microinjection and characterization of slc7a14 zebrafish mutants in collaboration with international scientists

    description: |2-        
        * Extensively applied molecular biology techniques to clone various mutants of the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR protein and identified the motif involved in proteolytic processing
        * Examined the protein-protein interactions between Amyloid protein precursor and p75NTR in Alzheimerâ€™s disease
